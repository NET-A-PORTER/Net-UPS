# ABSTRACT: shipment service from UPS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Instances of this class describe a particular shipping service. They
can be used as parameter to
L<Net::Async::Webservice::UPS/request_rate>, and are also used inside
L<Net::Async::Webservice::UPS::Response::Rate>, as returned by that
same method.

=attr C<code>

UPS service code, see
L<Net::Async::Webservice::UPS::Types/ServiceCode>. If you construct an
object passing only L</label>, the code corresponding to that label
will be used.

=cut

has code => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => ServiceCode,
);

=attr C<label>

UPS service label, see
L<Net::Async::Webservice::UPS::Types/ServiceLabel>. If you construct
an object passing only L</code>, the label corresponding to that code
will be used.

=cut

has label => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => ServiceLabel,
);

=attr C<total_charges>

If thes service has been returned by C<request_rate>, this is the
total charges for the shipment, equal to the sum of C<total_charges>
of all the rates in L</rates>.

=cut

has total_charges => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => Measure,
    required => 0,
);

=attr C<rates>

If thes service has been returned by C<request_rate>, this is a
arrayref of L<Net::Async::Webservice::UPS::Rate> for each package.

=cut

has rates => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => RateList,
    required => 0,
);

=attr C<rated_packages>

If thes service has been returned by C<request_rate>, this is a
arrayref of L<Net::Async::Webservice::UPS::Package> holding the rated
packages.

=cut

has rated_packages => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => PackageList,
    required => 0,
);

=attr C<guaranteed_days>

If thes service has been returned by C<request_rate>, this is number
of guaranteed days in transit.
